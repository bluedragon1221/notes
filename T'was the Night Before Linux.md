	Twas the night before Christmas  
	And all round the house  
	the only thing stirring  
	Were me and my mouse?
	
	I was working with windows  
	It was making me fractious,  
	And I knew that quite soon  
	I would have to take actions.
	
	It slowed and it stuttered  
	And finally froze  
	Then showed a “blue screen” at the end of my nose,  
	My anger was rising and thoughts turned quite bad,  
	“PC through the window, was one that I had”
	
	But my genetics and lineage ensured my calm;  
	And decided, the computer should come to no harm.  
	The O/S is to blame, and will never improve  
	I was conned by Bill Gates and this upgraded move.
	
	Then I had an idea as I sat in my muse,  
	I have other options like Mandrake or Suse;  
	Or Debian, Red Hat, or Fedora Core,  
	PClinux, Ubuntu and so many more..
	
	So I set to downloading a distro named Ubuntu;  
	And burned a CD for this data to use too,  
	It all went so smoothly,”I waited for hitches”,  
	As my mind was attuned to the Microsoft glitches!
	
	I entered the disc in my CD Rom drive  
	And sat back, and watched my PC come alive,  
	As it smoothly installed the O/S Ubuntu 9.10.  
	I know I will never use windows again.
	
	So to all you users of Microsoft software,  
	With its viruses, Trojans, and various Malware,  
	Blue screens, and freezes, and drivers to find,  
	Registry problems that muddle the mind  
	Take a leaf out of my book, “give Linux a try”,  
	Its all free of charge, with no programs to buy,  
	With so many versions of this excellent kernel  
	The choices you have are almost eternal
	
	So download a distro that won’t cost a penny,  
	The flavours of linux are varied and many  
	You’ll find one to suit, I’m sure of this;  
	And using your PC, will once more be bliss.
