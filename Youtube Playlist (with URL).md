# Final Product
A completely legitimate, shareable YouTube playlist with no account necessary.

# Get a Video ID
This is actually super simple. Say I want to place this video in a playlist.
```
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYm0kfnRTJk
```

The video ID is right after that `?v=` part. `UYm0kfnRTJk`

Now take note of the video ID for each of the videos you want in the playlist.

# Place it in a Playlist
```
http://www.youtube.com/watch_videos?video_ids=UYm0kfnRTJk,MNeX4EGtR5Y,U3aXWizDbQ4
```
See? I just listed the video IDs in a specific format.
