# No Frameworks
I do not use a framework like OhMyZSH for ZSH, or React for JavaScript.
I do this for a few reasons:

### Avoiding Bloat
Frameworks include a lot of bloat by default.
They come with everything necisary for a perfectly functioning system.
Since they must account for every type of user, they come with many features that the average user (me) won't need.

### Speed
Because of the amount of bloat in these frameworks, they aren't very fast.
Standard times on OhMyZSH are about `0.7 sec`.
As opposed to ZSH's `0.25 sec`.

### Control
By not using a framework, I have full control of my system.
I can easily find what scripts are being executed and what processes are happening.
In something like React, you need to sift though the compiled JavaScript to know what your website is doing under the hood.
With vanilla JavaScript, this is a lot easier.

## What I do instead
Instead of using these paridigm-inducing frameworks, I revert to a more manual approach.
This may mean importing cdn urls or cloning and sourcing git repos, but I like how I know what I have done to my system.
